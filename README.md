# Personal Portfolio – Bhoomika

A clean, modern personal portfolio website built using **HTML + CSS**.  
The purpose of this project is simple: create a portfolio that actually looks good, feels intentional, and doesn't look like a typical first-year template.

This website includes a bold white-and-purple aesthetic, glassmorphism elements, soft gradients, responsive layout, and a modern UI.
